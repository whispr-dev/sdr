fren can you take me through the necessareies to employ saopySDR as a library for the basis of a wifi invetigztion softweare suite focussing on a packet analyser? i have 99% of the code already written out but i was working with gr_ieee802_11 and gnuradio.soapy but i just can't get what i need from those libs conveniently and efectivley so i've decided to swap to soapysdr _now_ so i can get set for much more tricksy complex projects later ansd still be compatible with these!


fren — totally doable. Swapping to SoapySDR puts you closer to the metal (device-agnostic, clean RX/TX control, simple stream API) and keeps you compatible with Lime/RTL/USRP/etc. Below is a lean, production-ready capture core you can drop in as the I/Q front-end for your Wi-Fi packet analyzer. It handles device discovery, channel→frequency mapping, stream setup, overflow-safe reads, and writes timestamped chunks to disk (raw CF32 + a tiny JSON sidecar you can ingest in your existing pipeline). After that I list the “must-do” knobs for 802.11 work with Soapy, and how to fan this out into a demod/decoder chain.

Short legal note (UK, Europe/London time): passively recording RF may be regulated; only capture your own network or where you have clear permission.

What matters when using SoapySDR for 802.11

Device/module: install SoapySDR core + the driver for your radio (e.g., SoapyLMS7 for LimeSDR, SoapyRTLSDR for RTL, etc.). SoapyRemote lets you stream over LAN if you want to separate RF and DSP boxes.

Stream format: prefer CF32 (float32 I/Q) for DSP clarity; fall back to CS16 if USB bandwidth is tight.

Sample rate: 20 MS/s for 20 MHz Wi-Fi channels (40 MS/s for 40 MHz HT, if your radio can). You can also capture a bit wider (e.g., 22–25 MS/s) and decimate in software.

Frequency: 2.4 GHz center freq formula: f_MHz = 2412 + 5*(ch-1) for channels 1–13. (Ch14 = 2484 in JP only.) I include a helper.

Gains & front-end: start with manual gain (LNA/Mix/Baseband) not auto; set RF BW ~ 22–25 MHz for 20 MHz channels.

DC/IQ: enable DC offset cancel and IQ balance if your driver supports it.

Timing/buffers: query MTU, use a ring buffer, handle SOAPY_SDR_OVERFLOW.

Metadata: timestamp chunks; you can write SigMF later — here I write a simple .json sidecar per chunk to keep it frictionless.

Remote: optional SoapyRemote so your laptop ingests from a headless Lime/RTL on the network.
